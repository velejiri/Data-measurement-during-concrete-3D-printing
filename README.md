# Data-measurement-during-concrete-3D-printing
## Basic info
This work aims to set a basic framework for data collection during concrete 3D printing. Collected data could be used for static simulation, improvement of printing process and to develop system that can control water amount mixed with mortar and accelerant amount. This work was supported by the Grant Agency of the Czech Technical University in Prague, grant No. SGS 161 - 1612103E000.
